            Just view the page source code to see how the following examples work. In examples 1-4 there is no javascript
            you have to enter: you just need to add specific attributes to your &lt;select&gt; tags. In the 5th example,
            there's some JS to illustrate how to manually initialize the country-region selector.

        <p>
            Let's start with a simple, no-frills example. You can lay the fields out in your markup - as this one
            demonstrates - however you want - but for simplicity, the rest of the examples will just put them side to side.
        </p>

        <div>
            Country: <select class="crs-country" data-region-id="one"></select>
        </div>
        <div>
            Region: <select id="one"></select>
        </div>

        <hr size="1" />

<script src="dist/crs.min.js"></script>
